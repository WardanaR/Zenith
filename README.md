What is ollama? Ollama is an open-source project that serves as a powerful and user-friendly platform for running LLMs on your local machine. It acts as a bridge between the complexities of LLM technology and the desire for an accessible and customizable AI experience.

But, generaly ollama is using powershell to access it in windows. So i make this software as a GUI for ollama, without powershell. I make it by python code.
In this code, I use some python libraries:
- flet, python library for the GUI (for install, you can use: pip install flet)
- Ollama, python library for ollama (for install, you can use: pip install ollama)
- pyttsx3, python library for speech the response from model ollama (for install, you can use: pip install pyttsx3)

If you use or modified this code, please put my name. Thanks before.
